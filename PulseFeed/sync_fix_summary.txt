CloudKit Sync Fix Summary
=======================

Problem:
- macOS: 6,255 read items
- iPhone: 5,989 read items
- CloudKit: only 5,984 items (data loss)

Changes Made:

1. Enhanced Debug Logging:
   - Added device identification (macOS/iPhone/iPad)
   - Added timestamp logging
   - Added data size calculations
   - Added per-record save status
   - Added verification after CloudKit saves

2. Fixed Merge Logic:
   - Always prefer the larger dataset to avoid data loss
   - Added better conflict resolution
   - Used .allKeys save policy instead of .changedKeys

3. New Features Added:
   - Force Overwrite CloudKit button in settings
   - Post-save verification to confirm CloudKit actually saved data
   - Added data size logging to check for CloudKit size limits

4. Files Modified:
   - ReadStatusTracker.swift
   - SyncManager.swift
   - SettingsViewController.swift

5. Key Changes in SyncManager.swift:
   - Added verification read after CloudKit save
   - Added per-record save block for debugging
   - Added data size calculation before save
   - Enhanced error handling

6. Key Changes in ReadStatusTracker.swift:
   - Added forceOverwriteCloudKit() method
   - Enhanced debug logging with timestamps and device ID

7. Key Changes in SettingsViewController.swift:
   - Added "Force Overwrite CloudKit" button with warning
   - Added implementation for force overwrite functionality

Next Steps:
1. Build and test the app
2. Use the new debug features to identify why CloudKit isn't persisting data
3. Check the verification logs to see if data is being saved but then immediately lost
4. Consider CloudKit size limits (1MB per record) if data size is too large
5. Implement chunking if necessary for large datasets
