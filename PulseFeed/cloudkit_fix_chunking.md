# CloudKit Sync Issue - Root Cause and Fix

## Root Cause Identified

The verification logging revealed that CloudKit saves were **reporting success** in the completion handler but **failing silently** in the per-record handler with the error:

```
ERROR: Per-record save failed: Error saving record to server: record too large
```

Despite the data being only 0.60 MB (macOS) and 0.57 MB (iPhone), CloudKit was rejecting the records as too large.

## The Problem

- macOS: 6,255 read items
- iPhone: 5,989 read items  
- CloudKit: stuck at 5,984 items

CloudKit has undocumented internal limits on record size that are more restrictive than the advertised 1MB limit. Large arrays of strings (even small ones) can hit these limits.

## Solution: Chunked Sync

I implemented a `ChunkedSyncManager` that:

1. Splits large datasets into chunks of 1,000 items each
2. Saves each chunk as a separate CloudKit record
3. Maintains metadata about the total number of chunks
4. Reconstructs the full dataset when loading

### Key Changes

1. **New File: ChunkedSyncManager.swift**
   - Handles splitting data into chunks
   - Saves/loads chunks individually
   - Manages chunk metadata

2. **Updated: ReadStatusTracker.swift**
   - Uses chunked sync for datasets > 3,000 items
   - Falls back to regular sync for smaller datasets
   - Implements verification after saves

3. **Updated: SyncManager.swift**
   - Added post-save verification
   - Added data size logging
   - Added per-record save error handling

## How to Test

1. Build and deploy to both devices
2. On the device with MORE items (macOS):
   - Settings → Data Management → "Force Overwrite CloudKit"
   - This will use chunked sync to save all 6,255 items
3. On the other device (iPhone):
   - Pull to refresh
   - Should now receive all 6,255 items via chunked loading

## Expected Behavior

After implementing chunked sync:
- CloudKit will contain multiple chunk records instead of one large record
- Each chunk contains up to 1,000 items
- All devices will sync the complete dataset
- No more "record too large" errors

## Next Steps

1. Test the chunked sync implementation
2. Monitor logs for successful chunk saves/loads
3. Verify all devices have the same read count
4. Consider adjusting chunk size if needed (currently 1,000)
